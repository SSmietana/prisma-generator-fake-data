Hi, there!

I know reporting an issue can be as overwhelming as fixing it at times. To simplify the process for both of us, I created a CodeSandbox that you can access through this link: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/prisma-generator-fake-data-example-xplkvs. Feel free to fork it and try to replicate your scenario. Please avoid sharing any Personal Identifiable Information if you're sharing your own code! Also, don't forget to update the `prisma-generator-fake-data` version if it's out of date.

If you are unable to fork the CodeSandbox, please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to replicate the issue you are experiencing.
