Hi, there!

I know reporting an issue can be as overwhelming as fixing it at times. To simplify the process for both of us, I created [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/prisma-generator-fake-data-example-xplkvs?file=%2Fscript.ts&selection=%5B%7B%22endColumn%22%3A6%2C%22endLineNumber%22%3A38%2C%22startColumn%22%3A6%2C%22startLineNumber%22%3A38%7D%5D) that you can fork and try to replicate your scenario. Please avoid sharing any Personal Identifiable Information if you're sharing your own code! Also, don't forget to update the `prisma-generator-fake-data` version if it's out of date.

If you are unable to fork the CodeSandbox, please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to replicate the issue you are experiencing.
